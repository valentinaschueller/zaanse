# A Held & Hou Atmosphere

This is an experiment to see if we can implement a stable 2D Finite Difference discretization of the zonally averaged 3D Navier-Stokes equations on the sphere.
Ideally, we get something which produces similar results as Held & Hou in their 1980 paper. \[1\]
And if not, we will for sure have learned something ;)

This is a continuation of the work we did at the [Ferienakademie 2021](http://www.ferienakademie.de/) and which I prepared theoretically in [this repository](https://github.com/valentinaschueller/ferienakademie-2021-presentation).
